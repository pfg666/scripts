# Scripts
A selection of scripts I have come to rely on over the years. 
Note that I don't claim credit for any of these scripts. 
Indeed, many of them were found/inspired from scouring the Internet for quick solutions. 
Unfortunately, I wasn't good at logging the sources of these scripts. 
In any case, I thank the people who provided them. 

BTW, I am careful about copyright infringement.
