# Scripts
A selection of scripts I have come to rely on over the years (check disclaimer for credits).
I will briefly describe scripts that are particularly useful.

## Windows Scripts
### Audio Processing
Most audio processing scripts require the [ffmpeg][ffmpeg] library (please do donate for its continued development).

* [clip.bat](windows/audio/clip.bat)  - extracts from an audio file a portion identified by start and end time;
* [concat.bat](windows/audio/concat.bat) - concatenates two audio file into one.

## Linux Scripts
TBA

# Disclaimer
I don't claim credit for any of these scripts, since some were found/inspired from scouring the Internet.
In such cases, I thank the people who provided them (and where I haven't forgotten, I will credit them in the script itself).
